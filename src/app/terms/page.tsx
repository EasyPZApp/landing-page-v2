          <p>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</p>
          <p>
            In the event of any controversy, claim, dispute or disagreement
            arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the App,
            including but not limited to any claim or dispute regarding the
            interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these
            Terms, the parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve such
            controversy, claim, dispute or disagreement by mediation. If the
            parties are unable to resolve the dispute through mediation, then
            the dispute shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration,
            conducted by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the
            American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall take place
            in the city or county in which you reside, or in a mutually agreed
            upon location. The arbitration shall be conducted on an individual
            basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The
            arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding. Judgment on the
            award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
            jurisdiction thereof.
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
            the laws of the state in which EasyPZ is headquartered, without
            giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Any legal suit,
            action or proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms or
            the App shall be instituted exclusively in the federal or state
            courts located in the county in which EasyPZ is headquartered.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Termination</p>
          <p>
            EasyPZ may terminate these Terms and your use of the App at any time
            without notice. Upon termination, you must immediately stop using

          <p>Miscellaneous</p>
          <p>
            These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and EasyPZ
            regarding the use of the App. If any provision of these Terms is
            held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall
            continue to be valid and enforceable. Failure to enforce any
            provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
            provision or any other provision. These Terms are binding upon and
            shall inure to the benefit of each party's respective successors and
            assigns.
